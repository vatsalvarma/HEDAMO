  More About Hedamo:<br>
          The system operates on a principle of "disclosure over verification." Producers enter information about their products, attach supporting evidence when available, and publish these disclosures for various stakeholders to review. The value lies in structured transparency, not in third-party validation. Any user interface you create must honor this philosophical foundation—using language that emphasizes producer responsibility for disclosed information rather than suggesting institutional authority or endorsement.

<h2>About Hedamo</h2>
<p>
Hedamo is a disclosure platform designed to surface producer-reported
information with clarity and restraint. Hedamo does not verify accuracy
or completeness of submitted data.  Hedamo is a structured disclosure system designed to capture, organize, and present producer-declared information about products. It provides a framework for manufacturers and producers to document attributes, processes, and characteristics of their products in a standardized format.
Hedamo is explicitly NOT a certification body, verification authority, compliance system, or approval mechanism. It does not validate the accuracy of information provided by producers. It does not certify products as meeting specific standards. It does not approve or endorse products in any capacity. This distinction is fundamental to the system's design and must be clearly reflected in all language, interface design, and user communication.
The system operates on a principle of "disclosure over verification." Producers enter information about their products, attach supporting evidence when available, and publish these disclosures for various stakeholders to review. The value lies in structured transparency, not in third-party validation. Any user interface you create must honor this philosophical foundation—using language that emphasizes producer responsibility for disclosed information rather than suggesting institutional authority or endorsement.
Understanding this nuance is critical because it affects every design decision you make. Button labels, status indicators, confirmation messages, and help text must all reinforce that this is a disclosure platform where producers make claims and provide evidence, but where Hedamo itself does not stand behind those claims as a validator.
