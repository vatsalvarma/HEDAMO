## 🧠 Project Overview

**Hedamo** is a user interface that demonstrates how a structured disclosure system can present product information reported by producers. Rather than verifying or certifying product claims, the system displays disclosures as provided — helping users explore product data while maintaining clarity about the limits of accuracy and endorsement. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This project was built as part of a frontend developer assessment to show skills in UI design, data interaction, responsive layout, and professional frontend craft.
